PaperStack2.0 (almost identical to the original)
Created by Chris Day

Launch as a Java Application in Eclipse.

Warning this game is highly addictive. 

Because all of the code required for this game to run is in
the one PaperStack Class, you could possibly copy and paste 
the code into a new project and launch it that way. It 
would work but you would not have the image of the paper 
presser. 

Enjoy!
